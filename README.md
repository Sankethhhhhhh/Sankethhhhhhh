## 👨‍💻 About Me

I’m an AIML student focused on engineering depth over surface-level experimentation.

My work sits at the intersection of:

- **Machine Learning**
- **Core Computer Science fundamentals**
- **Backend and workflow systems**

I prioritize structured, scalable code and understanding how systems behave in real environments — not just completing assignments.

Consistency drives my growth. The same discipline I apply in training reflects in debugging, refactoring, and iterative improvement.

## 🧩 Engineering Principles

- Write code that is readable before it is clever  
- Understand complexity before optimizing  
- Treat projects like products — not submissions  
- Prefer clarity over hype  

---

## 📈 Current Direction

- Strengthening ML fundamentals with production awareness  
- Improving system design intuition
